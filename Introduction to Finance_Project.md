# A case study on an institution engaged in Cryptocurrency (Coinbase Inc.)

## Overview and Origin:
 
The question hotly discussed today  and posed to modern social, economic and political scientists is “how the future of the nations of the world is about to shape?”, is probably older than the mythical horoscope reading and renewed. Last few decades’ inventions have shaken the customary laws of Finance and Technological industries. As a result of that shake up, those industries have yielded a new brainchild called   FinTech.  Coinbase Inc., a FinTech company, is a leading actor and interesting player in Cryptocurrency brokering & exchange related services. Coinbase is a subsidiary of Coinbase Global Inc.  Coinbase is dealing with Cryptocurrency brokering & Internally, another sister company deals with the Cryptocurrency Exchange, named Coinbase Exchange. 

Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam founded Coinbase in June 2012 in San Francisco. Coinbase was formed by founders to create the “Open Financial System”. The firm is not operating anything much different from other Financial Services firms and it too charges a fee for its services. In fact it is known as one of the highest fee charging companies within its domain. 
Major funding for the startup came from venture capitalists. Founding Member Brian Armstrong too has invested in it. The current investment is $527 million, and its balance sheet is backed by more than $2 Billion worth of assets. With the appreciation of cryptocurrency assets, recent growth of the company is impressive. The company is soon to be listed on NASDAQ with the code of ‘COIN” by direct listing, no IPO. 

## Business Activities:
Coinbase started with Bitcoin exchange & brokering. Now it is dealing with all major cryptocurrencies. Company offers services to personal as well as corporate investors. Retail trade includes: 
1). Cryptocurrency buy, store and sell apps, 
2). Platform to Professional assets trading &
3). Decentralized crypto apps.  
For the institutional customers, it offers a platform for professional level trading and custody services to store the cryptocurrency coins. Their additional services are cryptocurrency payment systems, Crypto Visa Debit card and USD Coin, a stable coin directly pegged to the US dollar.  


The customers of this company are mainly institutions or traders & brokers. Basically, all products offered are interrelated and that is in Cryptocurrency. The payment services through PayPal  and  “Visa debit card” is not directly related to the trading side of the coins. The distributed processing system helps mining clients. There is no data seen on this company’s revenue analysis.  

As said earlier the company specializes in cryptocurrencies. Coins are highly prone for theft(hack). The security related to this trading is heavy. The database system uses the BlockChain Technology. Cryptocurrency coin registration needs that technology. The coin mining demands heavy milling power and algorithms solving ability for the systems. So, the required sophisticated hardware- software is a deterrent to easy entrance to this field. Many investors still have no confidence in cryptocurrency. The technology and market are recent. The specific knowledge needed to enter is a rare commodity. So, the company still is enjoying that newness as the advantage for it. Coinbase has been an early bird, entering the market. It has captured the market leadership, like one time IBM... AT &T. It offers high quality products and is very quality conscious. Now it is using its leadership to stay ahead of competition. The recent mistake committed by Robinhood in GME is suggesting Robinhood will need another two or three years to rebuild its confidence. Unlike Robinhood, Coinbase is market sensitive. 
Coinbase has already absorbed some technological companies in the fields of Blockchain, Security and Insurance. Blockchain is a noticeable advantage to Coinbase as it is essential to coin trading. Satoshi Nakamoto invented the Blockchain database to introduce his bitcoin. Coinbase records the transactions in the Blockchain system. In blockchain, new records are stacked over the old records thus the new one offers protection to older ones. Further they are read only, under normal circumstances. Then these are copied to many servers worldwide, operating under different security systems. Thus the  Data is split with redundancy, AES-256 encrypted, and copied to FIPS-140 USB drives and printed on  papers. So, these records are not hackable simultaneously in many systems, if hacked, they cannot be altered, then the restoration with USB drives is easy and verifiable with the paper backups.   

## Landscape:
Coinbase operates in the domain of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is one the fastest growing sectors in the Financial Industry. In the last two years, Coinbase had seen massive growth. Coinbase’s revenue grew from $528 Million for 2018 to $2 billion for last year. Last few years, especially in the five-year period, the cryptocurrency has received high recognition, confidence & acceptance. Cryptocurrencies are playing two-way roles; one is payment medium; same as the conventional currency, and the other is investment asset; bought and sold in the open market. New Visa debit card has come into operation. Larger investors have put their money in them, and larger companies have joined cryptocurrency companies as partners. There are many competitors for Coinbase. But the safety net for Coinbase thus far  is competitors themselves; they are specializing in different niche markets and different using different marketing techniques.  




Here are some of them and their leadership: 
TradeStation 	- 	Best Trading Platform
eToro 		-	Low Fees
Kraken 		-	Maker-Taker Fee Schedule
Bittrex 		-	Most Altcoins
Gemini 		-	Offers Gemini Dollar
Robinhood 	-	Best Mobile App

## Results:
Coinbase started with a promise of an Open Financial System for everybody. But Coinbase is recognized as one of the expensive companies in the domain. But it looks like still the object will be fulfilled, if not by Coinbase, but somebody else. That time the company may return to its own promise. But the biggest impact of the coinbase is cryptocurrencies getting acceptance by investors because of the reliable services rendered by the Coinbase.  

There is a problem in using the usual metrics in measuring the performances of this company:

 _Although risk-adjusted returns and conventional technical analysis may be applied to cryptocurrency trading strategies, for the majority of crypto-traders it will be an overkill. If we take some common risk measures, such as alpha, beta, R-squared, standard deviation and the Sharpe ratio it is quite unclear whether they will be of any use in the cryptocurrency space for now._

The problems suggested with using the conventional metrics are the Cryptocurrency industry is junior; coin trading is exceedingly small compared with regular stocks. Further Cryptocurrencies are relatively illiquid. But the suggestion is still using the conventional ratios can give indication of the performance of these companies to the management and investors.
In general, Coinbase has been a successful company, with high growth. In the past the net profit was not impressive. But Last two years it has shown good performance. Company is enjoying list topping leadership with 1,100 employees, offices in 32 countries, and transacting in 192 countries. 




## Recommendations:
Coinbase is narrowly sticking to its core domain. But not all competitors are like that. More the cryptocurrency gains acceptance, more the chance the conventional traders will be entering into the domain. This poses risk to Coinbase that it can be easily minuscule by conventional stock traders. Coinbase may want to explore conventional broking and trading. BJ’s SuperMarket chain is offering to fix solar panels and gutters for homeowners. Home Depot is selling throw blankets and mattresses. Companies are no longer willing to stick to a core trade. Coinbase, with synergy, can enter in Security Software and Enterprise Solutions. Coinbase has some start of the software security, which is  employed for Cryptocurrency. There are openings starting to come applying Blockchain technology in Enterprise solutions. Coinbase should venture into those two areas too . Security Software needs additional Technology in identifying Virus and Malware and Enterprise solutions would need working in ERPs. But getting into these areas will benefit Coinbase on its core product the Cryptocurrency and in the event that domain fails, Coinbase will have another domain to operate in.
